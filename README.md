# Project Management Portfolio — Stylized v2 (Static HTML)

**What’s improved**
- Much more **breathing space** (larger gaps, padding, line heights)
- Each project is a **card** with distinct sections:
  - Method (ribbon), Summary, Outcomes, Achievements, Difficulties, Lessons Learned
- Same modern theme with dark/light mode toggle
- Filter by methodology chips (All / Agile / Hybrid / Waterfall)

**Edit Quickly**
- Update `data/projects.json` to add images or tweak content.
- Replace hero buttons with your links in `index.html`.
- Customize spacing or colors in `assets/css/style.css`.

**Run locally**
```bash
cd pm-portfolio-stylized-v2
python -m http.server 8080
```
